- **Automatic Dependency Management**: Automatically installs PyInstaller if not present.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Git (for cloning GitHub repositories)
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with standard Python installations)

### Installation

## Using Lightning EXE

### Input Source Selection
When you launch Lightning EXE, you will be presented with options to select the source of your Python project. You can choose from the following:

- **Python File**: Select a single `.py` file.
- **Project Folder**: Select a folder containing your Python project.
- **GitHub Repository**: Enter the URL of a GitHub repository.

#### Selecting Input Source
1. In the **Input Source** tab, choose your input type using the radio buttons.
2. Depending on your selection, the corresponding input field will be displayed for you to provide the file path or URL.

### Output Options
In the **Build Options** tab, you can configure where the executable will be saved and how it will be packaged.

1. **Output Location**: Specify the directory where the executable will be stored.
2. **Packaging Options**:
   - **Create Single File Executable**: Check this box to bundle everything into a single executable file.
   - **Show Console Window**: Check this box if you want to see console output during execution, useful for debugging.

### Building the Executable
Once you have configured the input and output options:

1. Click the **âš¡ BUILD EXECUTABLE** button.
2. The progress bar will indicate the build status, and you will receive notifications upon completion or if any errors occur.

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting
- **Invalid Input Path**: Ensure that the path provided is correct and accessible.
- **Python File Requirement**: If you select a file, it must have a `.py` extension.
- **GitHub URL Validation**: Make sure you enter a valid GitHub repository URL.
- **Output Directory Issues**: Ensure the output directory exists or the application can create it.

If you encounter any issues, please refer to the messages displayed in the status area for guidance.
